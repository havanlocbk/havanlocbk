Hi, my name is Ha Van Loc. I graduated from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, majoring in Business Administration (School of Industrial Management).
I am currently working as an Operations Coordinator in the Demand Generation industry. I’m passionate about the data world — how it shapes our answers to business questions and helps uncover actionable insights.
